# Arcade Tribute
**Built with Godot 3.5.1.**

A tribute to the arcade classics Galaga and Space Invaders, in 3D. It exports perfectly to HTML, so you can play it online before downloading it. Requires a keyboard so probably no good on mobiles. Sorry!

The game was built on a ThinkPad X1 that only has an integrated graphics card. I couldn't even get Unity to run on it, but Godot starts up in seconds!

The models were created using Goxel.

Sound effects are freebies by Juhani Junkala, which can be found here: https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style.
